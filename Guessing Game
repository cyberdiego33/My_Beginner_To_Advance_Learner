Press 1 to start

Choose a number between 1 - 100

TIPS:
    if your guess is correct it prints correct and adds score
    if your guess is higher than the target by range 1 - 10 it prints High, elif it prints Too High
    if your guess is lower than the target by range 1 - 10 it prints Low, elif it prints Too Low
    if your trails is > 10 it asks if you want to continue/ new game or end
    When you are about to input a new guess; you can input ( Score ) to view score
    if input is string: Invalid Input
